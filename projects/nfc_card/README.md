# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It is a NFC card with a led. I put a qrcode, and a circle to show the translucent plastic near the led. I also plan to use the nfc to open a yt video("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
the card itself costs 3.10$, but shipping makes the total order cost 13.90$.


<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I put a qrcode, there should be texture, as didnt only put it on the silk layers. I also added a circle on top of the led, to see the translucent plastic. However, one thing that i had a problem with was making the card not short circuit. It took a lot of trial and error, but i finally made it.
